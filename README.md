# Astronomy Photo of the Day - GoLang

Pulls the photo of the day from a NASA API.
Written in GoLang as a "Hello World" experiment.

Note: This is my first GoLang App. I'd had never written anything in the language til this morning.
Or read any tutorials til yesterday.

Nice language, though ... not sure if I'd say the same if I have to write anything more than a few thousands lines long though.
